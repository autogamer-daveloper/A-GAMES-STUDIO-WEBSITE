                <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
              <p>This privacy policy applies to the Stylish Horizon app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by A Games Studio (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>
                  
                <h4>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h4>
              <p>The Application collects only the data necessary for its core functionality and advertising purposes:</p>
              <p>Advertising identifier – used to display ads in compliance with Google Play policies. Only non-personalized ads are shown, and no user tracking occurs.</p>
              <p>Account token – used for authentication when accessing cloud storage features. This is optional, and you can use the Application without it.</p>
              <p>The advertising identifier is required for generating reports and ensuring ad functionality. We comply with <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play's Designed for Families policies</a> and do not use this data for personalized advertising.</p>
              <p><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9007336?hl=ru#:~:text=%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D1%8B%20cookie%20%D0%B8%20%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8B,%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%20%D0%B8%20%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85%20%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2." target="_blank">More information about non-personalized and personalized advertising.</a></p>
                  
                <h4>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h4>
              <p>The Application does not collect or use precise real-time location data. However, third-party services (such as advertising networks) integrated into the Application may process limited technical information necessary for their functionality.</p>
                  
                <h4>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h4>
              <p>The Application integrates third-party services (such as advertising networks) that may process limited information solely for providing their respective functionalities. This includes non-personalized ads displayed by Google AdMob. These services comply with Google Play's Designed for Families policies and do not track users or collect personal data. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                  
                <h4>What are my opt-out rights?</h4>
              <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
                  
                <h4>Children</h4>
              <p>Since the Application is intended for a general audience, including children, we ensure compliance with Google Play's Designed for Families policies. The Application does not collect personal data, and all displayed ads are strictly non-personalized. If you have concerns regarding child privacy, please contact us at the email provided below.</p>
              
                <h4>Security</h4>
              <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since the Application does not collect any information, there is no risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p>
                  
                <h4>Changes</h4>
              <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
                  
                <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-06-01</p>
                  
              <h4>Your Consent</h4>
