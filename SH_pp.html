                <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
              <p>This privacy policy applies to the Stylish Horizon app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by A Games Studio (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>
                  
                <h4>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h4>
              <p>The Application does not obtain any information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the Application.</p>
                  
                <h4>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h4>
              <p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>
                  
                <h4>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h4>
              <p>Since the Application does not collect any information, no data is shared with third parties.</p>
                  
                <h4>What are my opt-out rights?</h4>
              <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
                  
                <h4>Children</h4>
              <p>Due to the fact that the target audience includes children, the Service Provider must mention child safety in the Application. The Application does not collect data, as the Application only contains non-personalized advertising, which will never collect information about you. If you have questions about this, the contacts will be below in this document.</p>
              
                <h4>Security</h4>
              <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since the Application does not collect any information, there is no risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p>
                  
                <h4>Changes</h4>
              <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
                  
                <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-06-01</p>
                  
              <h4>Your Consent</h4>
            <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.</p>
                  
                <h4>Contact Us</h4>
              <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at agamesstudio1987@gmail.com.</p>
